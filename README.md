# Female-Headed Households in South Afric (Zindi Archived Competition)

Built a predictive model to accurately estimate the percentage of households per district that are both female-headed and living below a particular income threshold.

## Overview

Female household headship has been on the rise in South African in recent years, yet these households tend to face greater social and economic challenges than male-headed households. The objective of this challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per district that are both 1) female-headed and 2) living below an income threshold of R19,600 through pre-existing data. Doing so can potentially reduce the cost of tracking the change of demographical characteristics between census years.

## Data

Since South Africa is divided into over 4,000 districts, Zindi has aggregated the target indicator and the other predictive variables from the 2011 South African census across all the households within each ward to create an aggregated value of each indicator per ward. The target variable of interest is the percentage of households per ward that are both female-headed and earn an annual income that is below R19,600 (which is approximately $2,300 USD in 2011).
